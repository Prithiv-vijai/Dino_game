# Dino_game
Designed a replica of the chrome dinosaur game Used CSS and HTML for the front end. Imported
the necessary images to make it look similar to
that of the original game. On understanding how the control and actions
are performed, implemented it using Javascript
internally to make it jump for the up and
spacebar key .Came out really cool and closer to the original
version.
